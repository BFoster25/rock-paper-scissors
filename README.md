Rock Paper Scissors: Best of 5 (First to 3 wins). User vs Computer!

This was my first project using JavaScript. Initially, this project instructed for the game to be done solely through the Console.

I utilized conditional statements and functions to make up the functionality of this project.

In a later DOM Manipulation lesson from "The Odin Project," one of the assignments was to give this game a simple UI.

Here, I added event listeners to the buttons. Whereas before, I was prompting the user to manually type in "rock," "paper," or "scissors."

In the future, I would like to add CSS to make this game more visually appealing.
